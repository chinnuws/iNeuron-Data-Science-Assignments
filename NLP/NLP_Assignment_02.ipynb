        "Lemmatization is a text normalization technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It has been studied for a very long time and lemmatization algorithms have been made since the 1960s. Essentially, lemmatization is a technique that switches any kind of a word to its base root mode. It is a linguistic term that means grouping together words with the same root or lemma but with different inflections or derivatives of meaning so they can be analyzed as one item. The aim is to take away inflectional suffixes and prefixes to bring out the word's dictionary form."
